NICC needs your help. They found an unknown encrypted file on their computer desktop. They believe it may tie back to RB, but they aren't sure how to access the file. They didn't want to give you their passwords in the clear, to prevent RB getting further access to their computer accounts, but they've provided everything you will need to open the encrypted file.
