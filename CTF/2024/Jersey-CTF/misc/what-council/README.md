* Remember that image file from sticky situation?
 * We had a witness come forward saying they saw the suspect leaving Cullimore's basement - right where we found the laptop.
 * Not sure if what they're saying is useful or true, but they claim the suspect was muttering something about 'The Council'.
 
 * Who's the council?
 
 * You still have that ad1, right?
 * If not: go get it. You're going to need it.
 
 * If *memory* serves me right, there was a flyer around campus talking about the council a while back. Maybe it's that?
