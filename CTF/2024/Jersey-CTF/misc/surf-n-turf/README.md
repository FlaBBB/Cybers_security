Our NICC agents have received these files from high command to help determine a potential base of operations. High command has encrypted the location of the potential base of operation to prevent the Rogue AI from knowing their movements. The file containing a voice prompt will help you get into the file telling where the potential base may be.

*Note: Once you figure out the location and there are spaces, replace them with underscores.*  `jctf{Name_of_Location}`
