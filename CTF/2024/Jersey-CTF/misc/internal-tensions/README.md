While preparing for JerseyCTF IV last month, I was going to help with updating our main website over at [jerseyctf.com](https://jerseyctf.com)...
As it turns out, I might have made a mistake when updating stuff and some of the staff are pretty disappointed with me now...
I thought it was fine! It didn't even show up on the website visibly... oh well.... hopefully no one was viewing the website all the way back last month.
