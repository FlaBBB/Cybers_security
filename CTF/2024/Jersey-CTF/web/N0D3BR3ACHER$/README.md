Welcome N0D3BR3ACHER intiate, your trial to become one of us, get the `/etc/passwd` file for this web server. We were able to get some of the project source code but we lost access, do what you can with it. Our informant had mentioned a major restructuring of their application, the vulnerable python code is no longer part of the application base.
