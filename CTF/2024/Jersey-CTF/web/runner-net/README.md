Great work cracking that pcap file! I think we saw some interesting traffic, and we were definitely onto something with Dr Tom's blog. Unfortunately - security seems tight. 

But fortunately for us - people are the weakest link and some people might still be celebrating st. paddy's based on this network capture we grabbed. Check it out and see if they slipped up anywhere.  It might be helpful to cross compare the old one, while you're at it.

I can't help but think there's more than that. Mary and Maya said they found a way in, but typical them - they're MIA. 
Probably back dancing the night away again.


**Flag format:** Exactly as it appears, which will be in the format `jctf{some_text}`.
