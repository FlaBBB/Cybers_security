* In a city completely integrated with technology and living expenses through the roof, one way to get ahead is to become a netrunner.
* One day while browsing at a convenient store you notice that someone installed a crypto skimmer at the checkout counter.
* This normally would charge the person an unnoticeable amount more but luckily you have a blocker on your wallet.
* Through a slight of hand, you snatch the device.
* You wonder: <b>Can I gain access to the crypto wallet on the device?</b>
* Encase the found crypto address as follows `jctf{ADDRESS}`
