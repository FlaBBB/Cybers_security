* I'm impressed you found our crypto address, we need a good netrunner for the next job. We are going to hit the biggest bank in the city, and we need someone competent to bypass security. The back door is the entry point into the bank, but it is locked by a pin code. We need that pin! 
* You gain access to the bank's system and download the control module for the pin lock.


Encase the found pin as follows: `jctf{FOUND_PIN}`
