## Description
* Joining a club is a fantastic way to meet people, make friends, further your educational and professional career, stop baddies, and have fun during your undergrad years. I definitely recommend it - and have made some great friends through clubs I've been in.
* You can always tell who was friends and who wasn't - they'll be in a lot of the same clubs!
* While some clubs, like NICC, attract people who are looking at professional development, others bring together people from multiple degree programs.
* The father of AI had a probable friend who became a pretty well known biologist. 
* Think you can tell me the clubs they were in and his friend's last name? Alphabetical order, please.

**Flag Format:** no spaces in club names, Capitalize it like it's a proper noun, and separate each part with an underscore. ex: jctf{ClubName_Club_Lastname}
