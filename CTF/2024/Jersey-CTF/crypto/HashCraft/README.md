The penetration testing team faces a challenging task: decrypting a file protected by a password known only to its meticulous owner. Historical password patterns have been uncovered, revealing a sequence of attempts: adminbackup, adminbackup1, !adminbackup1. Despite these insights, none have successfully unlocked the file. The task at hand requires a strategic approach, crafting a custom rule that mutates the foundational password, adminbackup, into a variant that has yet to be tried.
