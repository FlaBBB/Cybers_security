* The attached files were recovered from an attack committed by the malicious AI named RB.
* The first file contains fragments of code to implement an encryption scheme, this program is not complete.
* The second file contains the ciphertext generated through the use of the encryption schemes' code. There is also another value with the ciphertext, what could that be?
* The third file contains the logs from a comic book database attacked by RB, there may have been some clue left there about the password of the encryption scheme. 
* If RB intended to share this ecnrypted message with someone, then they must have shared some part of the public facing components of the encryption scheme. This information was most likely posted on the hacker's forum!
