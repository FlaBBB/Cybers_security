A local museum was recently hacked by an unknown threat actor. Upon investigation, we found that an administrator's password was sucessfully entered and a former employee sent a suspicious email the day prior to the incident. However, the only information found in the email was this image file. Is there any way the admin password could have been transferred in secret?
