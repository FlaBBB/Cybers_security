It looks like the evil hacker breakfastIsMyPassion(BIMP) has allied himself with Dr. Tom and the RB! BIMP has joined Dr. Tom's forums to discuss their plans. However, BIMP left some password hashes exposed on an old Windows virtual machine of theirs that we recovered. If we can crack their hashes, there's a chance they may have re-used one of their passwords for Dr. Tom's forums! Once you've cracked the hashes, see if you can login as breakfastIsMyPassion to get us a backdoor into the RB's operations!
