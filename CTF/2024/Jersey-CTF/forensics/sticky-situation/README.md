* Somebody found this laptop running in the basement of Cullimore - right by the mailroom.
* Normally we'd just turn it in, but with all of the cyberattacks and cyberpsychosis going on - we're not about to throw away evidence without examining it first.

* Examine this ad1, and see if anything sticks out to you.
* I find it useful to write down my thoughts and findings on whatever I have nearby - paper, sticky notes, etc.
* Once I have evidence, I put it on a wall or lay it on the table and start connecting the dots.
* Yes, I'm crazy with strings all over the wall - but it helps!
* Maybe you'll find my approach useful, too?
