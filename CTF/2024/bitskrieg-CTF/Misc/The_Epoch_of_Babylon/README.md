When I was going through MogamBro's PC, I found something strange in his calender application. Either he is a really busy person with lots of scheduled reminders, or maybe he is hiding something. I suspect it's the latter. I've attached the file containing the timestamps of all his reminders. Find out the secrets that MogamBro is hiding within them.
