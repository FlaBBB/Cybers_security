MogamBro has guarded your flag behind a grand equation. The equation involves 26 mysterious integers each constrained by a set of peculiar bounds. You need to find the number of solutions for the sum:

x1 + x2 + ... x26 = 69696969

The bounds are:

2008 <= x1  < 67434882
5828 <= x2  < 35387831
2933 <= x3  < 30133881
411  <= x4  < 63609725
4223 <= x5  < 18566959
1614 <= x6  < 25526751
5679 <= x7  < 44298843
6349 <= x8  < 26793895
117  <= x9  < 40292840
2321 <= x10 < 42293336
2281 <= x11 < 26301527
1939 <= x12 < 50793633
6273 <= x13 < 51546489
1477 <= x14 < 36871159
800  <= x15 < 65314188
4727 <= x16 < 15882817
2828 <= x17 < 40562779
1782 <= x18 < 48186923
1744 <= x19 < 37382713
2486 <= x20 < 56149154
6312 <= x21 < 18170199
2188 <= x22 < 63940428
5380 <= x23 < 58244044
1772 <= x24 < 29193116
2708 <= x25 < 22309445
1528 <= x26 < 40848052


The flag is equal to the remainder when the number of solutions is divided by 69696969.
Wrap the flag that you get in BITSCTF{}
