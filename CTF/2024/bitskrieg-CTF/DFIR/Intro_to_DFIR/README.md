DFIR or Digital Forensics and Incident Response is a field within cybersecurity that focuses on the identification, investigation, and remediation of cyberattacks. Here are the types of analysis you can expect throughout these sequence of challenges!

**Memory Analysis:**
Imagine being able to peek into the volatile memory of a computer system to extract valuable information about running processes, network connections, and even malicious activities. Memory analysis is a powerful technique used by digital forensics experts to gather evidence that might not be present on disk. Throughout this challenge, you'll learn how to extract and analyze memory dumps, identify suspicious processes, uncover hidden malware, and reconstruct user activity from memory artifacts.

**Network Analysis:**
Networks are the lifeblood of modern computing, but they can also be a treasure trove of forensic evidence. Network analysis involves examining data packets flowing through a network to identify communication patterns, detect unauthorized access, and reconstruct digital interactions. In this challenge, you'll have the opportunity to analyze network traffic captures to pinpoint malicious connections, identify data exfiltration attempts, and trace the paths of cyber attacks.
