MogamBro's brother was murdered by a relative of his. MogamBro approached the CID (Crime Investigation Department), who carried out a thorough investigation. But they were not able to figure out who the murderer was. We snuck into CID's computers and got this confidential investigation report. Your job is to figure out the identity of the murderer.
