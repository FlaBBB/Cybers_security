Name: slidering-flag
Value: 135
Description: The [GD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/776328#osu/1656233) I made was ranked in 2020. I am now releasing an unrankable version. I wonder why it looks so weird compared to the ranked diff, especially...the sliders?

Note: All characters you see should be uppercase, including flag format. Flag should fit this regex: `OSU\{[A-Z_]+\}`.
