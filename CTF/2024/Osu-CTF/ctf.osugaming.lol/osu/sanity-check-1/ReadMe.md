Description: My first map in 2024: [Gawr Gura - Kyoufuu All Back](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2143550)

Mapped for *osu!gaming CTF 2024*. Please play/watch the top diff with video on!

To osu! players: CTF is a competition where participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. The strings can be in plain text, images, encoded/encrypted, etc.

In sanity-check-1, checkout map metadata and submit the flag you found. Remember flag is always in format `osu{...}` unless otherwise specified.
