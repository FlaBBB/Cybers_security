Description: [Multi](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) is a game mode in osu! for people to play together in a multiplayer lobby. PvP is fun, isn't it?

Join the official CTF lobby **osu!gaming CTF 2024** to claim the flag! You are more than welcomed to stay in the lobby for a bit longer and have fun with others. ~~There may or may not be secret prizes for random game winners :D~~

Note: **Please behave nicely and follow the rules.** Avoid changing lobby name, kicking players, or spamming in chats. Do not spoil the fun for others! Report any misbehaviour to admins.
