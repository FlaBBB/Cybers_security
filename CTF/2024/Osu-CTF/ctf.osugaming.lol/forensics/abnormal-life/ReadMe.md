Description: Few people farm their own map for BP1. [I did](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/748836#osu/1577478). That was played 6 years ago though.

Recently I retried the top difficulty and got a terrible score. At least I passed the map with HDDT...But what happend to the life bar on the score screen?

Wrap the string in `osu{}`. Flag format is `osu\{[A-Z0-9_]+\}`.
