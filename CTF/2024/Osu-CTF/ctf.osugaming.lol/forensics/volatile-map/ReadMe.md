Description: Hey osu! players, our SOC team was informed that a group of spies from Mai Corp is trying to sabotage our infrastructure via their secret maps in osu!.

We were able to break into their rendezvous, unfortunately they noticed we are stealing their data and they corrupted them in time. Fortunately, we managed to get a full memory dump from one of their machines.

Can you help us to investigate what they were trying to do?
