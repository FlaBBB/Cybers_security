Name: Leaderbot dashboard
Value: 0
Description: One of the leaderbots tells you about the dashboard they have built. "Why was it built?" you ask.
<br><br>
"What do you mean, why was it built? It's a dashboard. You've got to build dashboards. It will show us the numbers."
<br><br>
"What will you do with the numbers?"
<br><br>
"Decide if it is a good dashboard or not, obviously. You're not quick to catch on are you? Plus, everyone knows adding more dashboards increases security by the percentage shown on the dashboard."
<br><br>

Convince the leaderbot that too much shadow IT might be decremental to security.
