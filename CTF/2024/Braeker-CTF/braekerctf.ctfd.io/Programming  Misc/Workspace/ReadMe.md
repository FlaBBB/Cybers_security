Description: A workerbot guides you through one of their factories. "Our manager likes to make issues, " he explains. "He also likes the idea of automation". Around you in the factory, bots are working in pipelines, performing automated actions to build automatas. "Since he likes issues, and automation, he put automation in issue creation so he can create issues while we automate. We'd like to raise issues ourselves, but our keys are not authorized."
<br><br>

Create an issue for the workers to help the working class stick it to the bot.
