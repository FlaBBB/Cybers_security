Name: Flag-based key expansion
Value: 0
Description: Through the trees you see a singing robot, rocking it on its keyboard. "Some day!" it sings, "Soome day, we'll expand all our keys, no one needs to see, except you and me. Can this pixel be us? Can it be cracked? Well if we hack it, we'll hack it togetheeer". The robot suddenly stops singing, making a sound that can only be described as a robot sighing. "What's wrong?" you ask. "I hashed the last four words of my lyrics to keep them safe, " the robot explains. "But I accidentally pixelized the image and now I can't read them!" 
<br><br>

Can you help the robot recover its lyrics?
