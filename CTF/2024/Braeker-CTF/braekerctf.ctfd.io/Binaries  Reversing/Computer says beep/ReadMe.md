Name: Computer says beep
Value: 0
Description: A confused PE binary has a bad case of the beeps. "It's hard being a beeping binary. Lately I've been beeping and I don't even know where the beeps are coming from. It's like I'm unconsciously beeping before my beeps even beep."

Can you figure out where the beeps are coming from?
