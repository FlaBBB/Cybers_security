**Hint:**

- Just to be clear, the zero-day vulnerability is in https://github.com/meyfa/php-svg, not Laravel
- However, you can utilize "something" in Laravel to craft the exploit
- As written on the Docker configuration, the PHP version used is PHP < 8, so you can utilize its "insecure-by-default" feature.
