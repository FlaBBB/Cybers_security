I found this hidden challenge in techcompfest website. But this challenge 
is not listed in the challenge list. And there is an limited time to download 
the file. So I download it immediately while capturing the traffic using 
wireshark so i can review it later. Please i need you to help me to solve this 
challenge. I'm not good at **pwning** but I can fix the file given to get that 
binary. Here is the pcap file. I think the website still up but we can't 
download it anymore, but you can find it in my captured traffic. I hope you 
can help me to solve this challenge. Thank you.
